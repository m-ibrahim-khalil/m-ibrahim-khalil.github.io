I’m a dedicated **Software Engineer** with nearly 3 years of experience in **Web Development** and **Data Engineering**. I graduated with a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering** from the **Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka** 🎓, recognized as the leading institution for Software Engineering in Bangladesh. My industry work, particularly in building data pipelines, automating software processes, and collaborating with data scientists, has driven my passion to explore how AI/ML can transform software engineering tasks.

I am currently working as a **Software Engineer** at **[Cefalo](https://www.cefalo.com/)**, a Norway-based software development and IT service provider company. I am also a **Research Assistant** at the **[Software Engineering Research Group (SERG)](https://serg.iit.du.ac.bd/)**, where I am actively involved in research projects focusing on **AI in Software Engineering**. I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for **Fall 2025** to further explore my research interests in **AI and ML** in **Software Engineering**.

### Research Interest Areas:

My career has given me practical experience, but I now aim to deepen my understanding of AI and Machine Learning's theoretical foundations and their application to software engineering. I am particularly interested in pursuing a PhD to focus on these research areas:

- 🌐 **AI for SE (AI4SE)** (Automated Code Generation and Repair, Code Prediction/ Contextual IDE, AI-assisted Software Testing)
- 🔄 **ML in SE** (Software Defects Prediction, software Effort Estimation)
- 📊 **Data-Driven SE** (Software Analytics, Software Metrics, Software Quality)
- 🤖 **Deep Learning** (Deep Learning for SE, Neural Networks, NLP)
- 🧠 **AI for HCI in SE** (Community Smell, Developer Behavior, Accessibility)
